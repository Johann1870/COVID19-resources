      The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found in cerebrospinal fluid in autopsies. There are other indications that is is crossing the blood brain barrier including neurological impairment even in ‘recovered’ patients. The virus has been shown to infect the dorsal respiratory groups on the medulla causing involuntary inhalation to shut down (you forget to breath). This is also why most people hospitalised with the disease require mechanical ventilation since otherwise they suffocate to death.

      Long term effects are still poorly understood since it is so new, however initial results have shown continued involuntary reflex issues, and lesions in areas with high ACE2 receptors (a protein the virus targets). This includes the kidneys and testicles both of which show impaired functionality after the disease.
