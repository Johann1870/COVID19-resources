    There are 924,107 hospital beds in the US including 97,776 ICU beds.
    The United States has 168,900 ventilators including reserves. Approximately 5% of people with COVID-19 require intensive care.
  </p>

<p>
    Between 50 and 70% of people in the US are expected to be infected even with the moderate social distancing being planned by local governments across the country (schools closed, events cancelled, work from home policies instituted). That is, on the low end, around 165,000,000 people. The lowest estimated mortality from a country with substantially better health care whose hospitals were not overwhelmed is around 0.6%. That is 990,000 dead in the US, more than twice the number killed in WWII. Many other estimates show the mortality rate at closer to 3.4%  which would result in 5.6 million dead. 8.25 million will require intensive care, approximately 84 people per available bed.
</p>

<p>
    The actual R0 number is around 2.4, which means each person infects, on average 2.4 other people. With current numbers, the United States could be looking at over 1 million cases by mid April and 50% infection by mid May; however it is estimated there are a significant number of unreported cases in the US due to the unavailability of testing and asymptomatic carriers.
